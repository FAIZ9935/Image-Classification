# Image-Classification


▪ Worked on CIFAR 10 dataset which is having total 60000 images of different 10 categories.

▪ Using 4 different machine learning algorithms (Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN), Naive Bayes 
Classifier(GaussianNB)) and compared their accuracy.

▪ Classify the image using algorithm which is have best accuracy i.e. Random Forest Classifier
